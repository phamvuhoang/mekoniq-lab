# Plan 01 remediation — implementation and verification record

2026-11-05. Scope: R01–R12 from the [original review](2026-11-05-plan-01-code-review.md), the backup corruption test, and all 18 remaining Plan 01 software gaps under the [remediation plan](../plans/2026-11-05-digital-twin/04-plan-01-remediation.md). Implementation and targeted regressions are present. Final release evidence is pending; this record does not accept R-MOCK or Plans 02/03.

## Final evidence fields

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| Final clean source revision | **PENDING — root to record** |
| Final Lab revision | **PENDING — root to record** |
| Exported runtime commit / artifact SHA-256 / schema hash | **PENDING — root to record after clean export/import** |
| Full CI-equivalent regression and final pinned browser runs | **PENDING — root recorder running separately** |
| Final offline bundle and renderer capture checksums | **PENDING — root recorder to supply** |
| Final evidence review / R-MOCK acceptance | **PENDING — owner decision; external gates below remain separate** |

The runtime actually installed is identified by [`source-runtime.lock.json`](../../config/source-runtime.lock.json). The existing [compatibility snapshot](../../config/simulation-compatibility.json) and [mock report](../implementation/evidence/digital-twin-v2/mock-report.md) retain their recorded revisions until regenerated. Earlier failures and skips are not converted to final passes by this document.

## R01–R12 behavior changes

| Review item | Implemented correction | Regression entry points |
|---|---|---|
| R01 | Persist absent-cup observations; invalidate pre-dispense verification; hold preparation/quality/transfer when evidence is missing. Safe empty-cup correction emits a fresh bound observation. | Source `coffee-review`, `coffee-policy`, `lab-v2-software-gaps` |
| R02 | Check arm readiness, fault and freshness before either transfer leg; rejected requests acquire no new lease/effect. | Source `coffee-review` |
| R03 | Count prepared coffee once; sequential cups of one order and valid remakes respect the quantity ledger. | Source `coffee-review`, `coffee-policy` |
| R04 | Reserve/consume repeated ingredient steps independently with job/step deduplication. Reject duplicate resource/allocation identities before admission. | Source `coffee-review`, `coffee-conservation`, `coffee-policy` |
| R05 | Manual coffee handoff atomically updates fulfillment, job, custody and leases; removed or pending-transfer cups refuse the entire handoff. | Source `coffee-review`, `coffee-conservation` |
| R06 | Localization loss stays latched while idle, moving or awaiting confirmation; commands cannot silently restore it. | Source `lab-v2-runtime-review` |
| R07 | Persist an independent publication sequence; same-tick action samples survive recording, stream cursors and replay. | Source `lab-v2-runtime-review`, `lab-v2-stream`; Lab `workspace-replay-freshness` |
| R08 | Rebuild replay cup/job/arm/measurement/served state at the selected time; filter plant and collision evidence; keep unavailable history explicit. | Lab `workspace-replay-freshness`, `report-replay`, `arm-scene-scope` |
| R09 | Repaint scene and inspector when freshness/link category changes with no new pose sample. | Lab `workspace-replay-freshness` |
| R10 | Correlate wait by mission/stop/allocation; partial, duplicate and cancelled confirmations have explicit treatment in both KPI implementations. | Source `lab-human-wait`; Lab `report-human-wait` |
| R11 | Measure footprint separation between robot pairs separately from wall clearance; one robot reports `SINGLE_ROBOT`. | Source `lab-v2-runtime-review`; both human-wait/KPI suites |
| R12 | Recheck authorization and close both open SSE streams at pairing expiry, releasing registrations. | Source `lab-v2-stream` |

Source remains authoritative for business state, inventory, custody and effects. Mock correction/reconciliation never fabricates native success or replays an uncertain irreversible command. The backup regression now changes a byte with XOR and asserts the mutation occurred; a unit check covers all 256 initial byte values. This fixes a deterministic weakness in the test injection without claiming every historical failure had the same cause.

## Eighteen former software gaps

The table records implemented behavior and its checks. Final pass rows belong to the regenerated acceptance evidence, not this implementation inventory. Test stems below refer to `.test.ts` under source `tests/integration` or Lab `tests/unit`, unless another location is named.

| Requirement | Implemented scope | Checks / artifact |
|---|---|---|
| QA-02b | Locked design/configuration/recipe/model/adapter/profile hashes and explicit uncalibrated provenance. | Source `lab-v2-software-gaps` |
| QA-09b | Immutable saved reports; model/world/recipe/profile scope staleness, including the declared arm profile. | Lab `report-evidence`; browser `twin-inputs.spec.ts` |
| FD02-cups | Identified food and coffee allocations share one mission with separate kitchen/cell loads and conserved custody. | Source `lab-v2-mixed` |
| BV02-capacity | Capacity/headspace admission includes declared ice displacement assumptions. | Source `coffee-policy` |
| BV04-outlier | Implausible measurements retain raw evidence and do not book invalid stock consumption. | Source `coffee-policy` |
| BV06-capacity | Cup/recipe capacity constraints checked before reservation/effects. | Source `coffee-policy` |
| BV07-timeout | Bounded transient-interlock and pickup waits preserve poured/unknown cup state. | Source `lab-v2-software-gaps` |
| BV08-milk-policy | Versioned batch/cold-handling evidence persists across reboot and gates preparation/quality. | Source `coffee-policy` |
| CAMPAIGN-FD02+FD07+BV01+BV03 | Versioned two-AMR food/coffee contention workload with two identified cups; queue/travel/human-wait/cell-busy KPIs. It ends after customer handoffs; parking is covered by separate scenarios. | Source `lab-v2-mixed`, `tests/unit/lab-process-metrics.test.ts`, `lab-v2-report` |
| ARM03 | Conservative capsule swept collision checks and declared project/AMR scene integration with bounded geometry evidence. | Source `lab-v2-arm-safety-model`, `lab-v2-arm-scene`; Lab `arm-scene-scope` |
| ARM05 | Modeled following-error/stop/E-stop states; reset preserves uncertain program and cup custody. | Source `lab-v2-arm-safety-model`, `lab-v2-arm-faults` |
| SYS01-render | Fixed-seed/fixed-step journal independence across 15/60 FPS and actual Chrome frozen lifecycle. | Lab browser `twin-plan01.spec.ts`; final pinned execution pending |
| SYS02-reclaim | Proof-protected durable reclaim; exact stored project/seed; view/reconcile fencing; explicit target selection for multiple robots. | Source `lab-v2-stream`, `lab-v2-reclaim-targets`; Lab `workspace-reclaim` |
| SYS03-reorder | Delay/reorder real observations while retaining identity and preventing duplicate serving/execution. | Source `lab-v2-software-gaps` |
| UX-05-reset-speed | New immutable run at tick zero; preserved old evidence; wall-clock pacing with fixed simulation steps. | Lab `workspace-replay-freshness`; browser `twin-inputs.spec.ts` |
| UX-18-speed | Explicit positive AMR speed limit up to 0.5 m/s reaches admission and plant without mutating the active run. | Source `lab-v2-software-gaps`; Lab `core-design-world`, `workspace-replay-freshness` |
| R-MOCK-offline-bundle | Platform-specific bundle includes Node, compiled UI dependencies, pinned runtime/schemas, lock and integrity inventory. | Lab `tests/integration/offline-bundle.test.ts`; `scripts/build-offline.mjs` |
| UI-perf-p95 | Rerunnable >=60 s actual-renderer capture for 2 AMRs, arm and six tables; desktop and emulated tablet 2D thresholds declared before capture. | `scripts/measure-twin-ui.mjs`; final capture pending |

Other corrected edges include repeat project migration, retry after synchronous IndexedDB open failure, bounded SSE reconnect backoff, active-run retention during preset selection, localized common state labels, artifact audit parsing, launcher token/port handling and legacy checkpoint receiver-evidence initialization. These are software corrections, not additional hardware claims.

## Independent review follow-ups

The coffee/arm/packaging review found duplicate recipe resource identities, audit false positives in a real exported bundle, and a custom offline UI port that violated runtime origin admission. Scoped re-review marked those three findings addressed. The offline UI port remains 4175; importing/exporting still rejects real external executable dependencies and credential shapes.

The runtime/Lab review found reclaimed edited inputs replaced by preset defaults (RL01) and missing reconciliation targets (RL02). Reclaim now returns the source record's locked inputs, validated by Lab for scene/evidence/reset. Waiting-stop reclaim is covered by real FD01 seed 42 at tick 691: its completed navigation still exposes the known load-stop robot. Multiple active robots produce separate identities and require explicit selection in the UI. Scoped re-review at 12:42 marked RL01/RL02 resolved; its result does not replace final exported-runtime browser or release acceptance.

The final arm review resolved **AR01–AR03**. AR01 restores source-only CI's optional sibling-fixture policy, while `LAB_V2_REQUIRE_LAB_FIXTURES=1` still fails when the required Lab fixture is missing. AR02 gives inactive project AMRs explicit, hashed static parking poses and retains them as obstacles; absent parking remains unknown rather than clearance. AR03 replays retained collision intervals/first-failure geometry at their recorded times, clips interval ranges, excludes future worlds, and marks truncated history incomplete. The adjacent future stop/reset leak is also fixed by reconstructing state from cursor-bounded observed/reset events. The independent review's real BV01 probe retained the tick-1 collision and stop stages from a final tick-1450 report, with no collision result at tick 0.

A full-source preflight initially recorded three regressions: FD02-cups could not load, its cancellation case could not reach return, and a manifest assertion expected only one profile. The first two were resolved by AR02's inactive-AMR treatment; the stale assertion now checks the exact runtime and declared arm-scene profiles, hashes and immutability. The subsequent **60 tests across seven source suites passed**, with typecheck and diff checks also passing. This scoped follow-up resolves those three preflight failures; the final whole-CI and exported-runtime fields above remain pending.

## Operating and fidelity boundaries

Build the offline package after importing a clean runtime and rebuilding the UI:

```sh
pnpm check:source
pnpm build
node scripts/build-offline.mjs --out /tmp/mekoniq-lab-offline
cd /tmp/mekoniq-lab-offline
./start
```

The output directory must be new. `./start` executes the bundled Node; the recipient needs no package-manager install or download. Build separately on each OS/architecture. Pair via the terminal's one-use code at `http://127.0.0.1:4175`. See [README](../../README.md) for storage and port details.

Arm scene claims require a valid versioned SI profile, declared base transform/heights and known compiled AMR geometry. Missing profiles retain self/injected-only scope. Bounds are conservative and illustrative; unresolved sweeps do not pass. Reported checks and retained geometry evidence establish the declared model's behavior only. See [compatibility and fidelity](../simulation-compatibility.md).

The cell-adapter contract change requires `lab-v2-provider/2`. The final compatibility snapshot will record the new contract hashes; the `/1` snapshot remains historical, and external providers need fresh binding evidence.

| Remaining gate | Status / limit |
|---|---|
| Final software verification, clean pin and evidence review | Pending fields above; no fresh final CI pass claimed here. |
| UX-01-time | Needs representative human task timing. |
| Fresh macOS / network-off / cold boot | Needs actual host setup/disconnection/reboot evidence. A package-manager-free process test does not close these. |
| R-MOCK-linux | Requires a fresh Linux build/run; macOS evidence does not transfer. |
| Physical tablet timing | Separate device gate. The existing capture uses tablet viewport emulation on a Mac. |
| R-SIM / G-SIM-NAV / G-SIM-ARM | Require their provider, scene and fidelity evidence under Plan 02/03. Mock geometric checking alone does not close them. |
| G-HW-READY / G-HW-ACCEPT / G-VENUE | Require calibrated/native/physical and venue evidence. No robot, servo, grip, spill or physical stopping validation is claimed. |

No acceptance status, historical failure, final runtime pin or evidence checksum is silently replaced by this document.
